# London Cholera Epidemic Visualization Dashboard

This is a dashboard of visualizations that looks into the 1854 cholera outbreak in London. The graphs examine the locations and demographics of deaths during the 
outbreak. This was inspired by the original investigation and map conducted by John Snow. The visualizations were created using the JavaScript library, D3. 
The files in the repository include many .csv files with different data sources, the main web page (index.html), and a page for documentation of the project.

The dashboard can be seen through the recent work section at https://jorockey.github.io/.
